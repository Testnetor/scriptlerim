This repository contains my personal collection of scripts for managing crypto nodes, airdrop hunting, and infrastructure automation.

✅ What’s inside:
Node installation scripts

Snapshot backup & restore scripts

Port checking and validator health check scripts

Crontab cleanup automation

RPC and log cleanup scripts

Airdrop eligibility checker bot skeletons

Testnet & mainnet quick deployment scripts

All scripts are clean, well-commented, and designed for fast deployment on your own servers.

🎯 Purpose
Speed up routine node and validator management

Help newcomers deploy testnet and mainnet nodes easily

Eliminate repetitive manual tasks and save time

⚠️ Disclaimer
These scripts are tested on personal test environments only.
Use at your own risk and review them before running on your mainnet infrastructure.
Adapt credentials, SSH keys, and configurations to your environment before running.
